# Sapeli
A Simple Linux UCI Chess960 engine

## Overview
A long time ago I wrote this program from scratch.
Sapeli is 100% original C code.
Design: A simple and hackable code base and modular architecture.
For: Linux/Unix platforms.
Variants: Chess960 and KOTH960

## Usage
Simple `make` command should build a good binary.
For Windows builds use this flag: `-DWINDOWS`.
Modify `HASH_KEY` to fit your RAM/system.

## The End
Sapeli 2.0 shall be the last Sapeli ever.
Sapeli's legacy shall be speed, simplicity and originality !
Goodbye !
